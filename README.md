# DRFD-prior

This repository contains the implementation of the paper: Distributionally Robust Fault Detection Trade-off Design with Prior Fault Information ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20237)).

## Problem Formulation

We presented a new distributionally robust fault detection (DRFD) trade-off design scheme in this work by utilizing prior fault information. The key contribution includes a novel distributional robustness metric of detecting a known fault and a new relaxed distributionally robust chance constraint that ensures robust detectability. Then, a new DRFD design problem of fault detection under unknown probability distributions is proposed, and this offers a flexible balance between the robustness of detecting known critical faults and the overall detectability against all possible faults. <br/>
